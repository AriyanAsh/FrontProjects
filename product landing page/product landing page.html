        <h3>What is a VPN?</h3>
        <p>VPN stands for “virtual private network.”
             It's a service that gives you safe and private access to the internet.
              By encrypting your connection, a VPN hides your IP and online activity
               from spying eyes and keeps your data safe from cybercriminals.</p>

        <h3>Why NordVPN?</h3>
        <h5>Protect yourself online</h5>
            <p>Thanks to all kinds of nifty, cutting-edge technology, NordVPN keeps your
             devices malware free and your browsing safe from strangers’ eyes. How safe?
              It would take the world’s most powerful computer billions of years to
               unencrypt your data — that safe.</p>

        <h5>Browse without interruption</h5>
                <P>We know you have emails to send, games to beat, and videos to watch,
                     so NordVPN will ensure the best VPN connection speeds possible.
                      You get unlimited data, thousands of VPN servers worldwide, and modern
                       VPN protocols working quickly to deliver you the best internet experience
                        without interruptions.</P>

        <h5>Control your private data</h5>
                <p>With NordVPN, you can browse like no one’s watching — because no one is.
                     We don’t track what you do online (and have undergone audits to prove it.)
                      And if you want extra privacy features, you can instantly double your 
                      protection by connecting to Double VPN servers — it will encrypt your data and 
                      change your IP twice.</p>

        <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
        <fieldset>
        <h3>Is it legal to use NordVPN?</h3>
        <p>Yes, VPNs are legal in most countries around the world,
             including the US, Canada, and most of Europe, as long as you don’t
              do anything illegal while using one.
            However, countries that enforce online surveillance and censorship may
             restrict VPN usage or ban VPN services altogether. For example, VPNs are
             illegal in North Korea, Belarus, Oman, Iraq, and Turkmenistan. Other countries,
              like Russia and China, heavily restrict the use of VPNs.</p>
        </fieldset>

        <fieldset>
            <h3>Why should I pay for a VPN service?</h3>
            <p>You should pay to get a better service. It’s difficult for free VPN providers
                to match the service quality and internet safety a paid provider offers, 
                so you’re more likely to experience slow connections and weak security. 
                If you use a free VPN, its creators have to make money somehow, so they 
                may shower you with ads, track and sell your data, or even use your device
                 to route other people’s traffic through — a reliable paid VPN provider won’t.
                With NordVPN, you can rest assured that your private data is protected by cutting-edge
                 encryption so you can experience enhanced online privacy while browsing without 
                 restrictions on data and bandwidth. Still not sure? You can try our services and get
                  a full refund within a month of purchase if you’re not satisfied.</p>
        </fieldset>

        <fieldset>
            <h3>Can I use NordVPN while traveling abroad?</h3>
            <p>Yes, you can use NordVPN while traveling. By sending your data through an encrypted
                 VPN tunnel, it will help you stay safe on unsecured wireless networks and provide 
                 access to the content and sites you’re used to back home. Just make sure to download
                  the apps and get your subscription before you leave — they might not be available if
                   you’re visiting a more restrictive country.</p>
        </fieldset>

        <fieldset>
            <h3>Which devices does NordVPN support?</h3>
            <p>NordVPN is compatible with all major operating systems: Windows,
                 macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android. Install it on a work laptop, your kid’s
                 iPad, and your own mobile device without worry — you can connect up to six 
                 devices at the same time. If you want to go one step further, you can also 
                 set up NordVPN on Wi-Fi routers, smart TVs, gaming consoles, and other devices,
                  extending VPN protection to the entire network.</p>

            <h3>How do I contact NordVPN’s customer support?</h3>
            <p>Whenever you need some help from us, you can send us an email or hop on a live
                 chat with one of our customer support agents. Slow connection? Not sure how to
                  use the apps? Have questions about your subscription? Ask us anything — we’ll
                   sort it out.</p>
